                    <p>The proposal I submitted at the beginning of the class was a responsive light installation. I
                        imagined the work would accompany a concert.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The logic seemed simple – lights, projection, and an algorithm. In terms of aesthetic, what I
                        had in mind are dreamy constellations. I initially hoped to go fully analog – relying more on
                        physics and less on digital technology.

                    <p>After experimenting with glass, realized I would have to commission a custom piece, which would
                        be expensive. My classmate Dan recommended polycarbonate – a cheap material with optic
                        properties. When heated, polycarbonate fractures internally and refracts. To amplify this
                        effect, I lined the bottom of my structure with reflective film.
                    </p>
                    <p>To house the wiring, I made the base out of sheet metal steel. The process was much smoother than
                        my first attempt at working with the medium.</p>

                    <p>Initially I wanted to use water at the base of the structure, but I quickly realized that water
                        and electronics don’t mix well. Instead, I adapted Neil's LED array. Using the vinyl cutter, I
                        cut traces out of a flexible copper sheet then mounted those to a large piece of foam core.
                        Having had established a serial connection in a couple of weeks prior I programmed the array to
                        communicate with my microphone board.</p>

                    <p>The question of what aspect of music I wanted to illustrate loomed over me. Is it amplitude,
                        pitch, frequency? My original intention was to have an algorithm in place that tracks subtle
                        audio qualities without being too obvious. </p>
                    <p>Much like the other aspects of the project, my vision changed with time. I went with rhythm. The
                        decision was subjective though I was influenced by dance parties. To capture rhythm, I
                        programmed my microphone board with a beat detection algorithm.</p>

                    <p>After taking Physics 123 with Tom Hayes at Harvard, I decided to revist this project but do it
                        using analog components. An approach that is not only more economic in terms of $$$ but also
                        seemed more intuitive to me. Sound is an analog phenomenon so it makes sense to analyze it using
                        analog parts. Moreover, for a novice, a simpler approach is less dizzying and intimidating, thus
                        going further in terms of academic purposes.

                        Some notes on the schematic: the signal is picked up by a microphone and amplified using an
                        op-amp. It is then fed into a comparator directly (a potentiometer can be used to tweak the
                        voltage level) and through a leaky peak detector comprised of a diode, two
                        resistors, and a capacitor. The output of the comparator then turns an LED on or off, thus
                        flickering with the beat.</p>

                            tutorial. Following his steps, I made a parametric press-fit dodecahedron (my Rhino and
                            Grasshopper files). At the base of the structure is a regular pentagon, held together
                            with circular parts. The joints can be resized dynamically.</p>
                        <p>I laser cut the pieces of our cardboard which was a forgiving material — all the joints
                                slid into place.</p>

                        <p>I returned to the same shape for this week's assignment. I designed a dodecahedron (using Rhino) with an inner cube. While learning about the shape I thought it was cool that a cube can be constructed from the vertices of a dodecahedron (Steinhaus 1999). I also wanted to 3D print something that wasn’t possible to make using a subtractive tool like a CNC. I used the Formalabs and 3DWOX to make models at different scales. The first couple of attempts were unsuccessful – not enough support, too little resin, excessive support, etc, but I eventually got it.</p>

For my dodecahedron I tried to use 123D Catch which did not turn out great. I would’ve liked to experiment scanning against different backgrounds.</p>

                        This week's assignment was challenging. I thought Eagle was janky (no partial search/match). The exported outer cut was too thin for the Roland (the table saw came in handy). The soldering was pretty smooth though. When testing my board, all of the traces seemed to check out.</p>

                        <p>Working with metal has been something I've always wanted to do but I never had access to a metal shop… until now. I decided to make a light fixture. A cropped pyramid with openings from which light would be able to escape. While I was content with my design in Rhino, the final product was disappointing. On the brighter side, I got to use a grinder and nibbler. Hammering metal into shape was satisfying, empowering, and addicting.</p>

                            forward. I’d love for this site to be a useful source of encouragement. I made it using CSS,
