                        <p>The proposal I submitted at the beginning of the class was a responsive light installation. I
                            imagined the work would accompany a concert. The logic seemed simple — lights, projection,
                            and an algorithm. Aesthetically, I dreamt of floating constellations. I hoped to go fully
                            analog, relying more on physics and less on digital technology.

                        <p>After experimenting with glass, I realized I would have to commission a custom piece, which
                            would be expensive. My classmate <a
                                href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/section.CBA/people/Oran/index.html">Dan</a>
                            recommended polycarbonate — a cheap material with optic
                            properties. When heated, polycarbonate fractures internally and refracts. To amplify this
                            effect, I lined the bottom of my structure with reflective film.
                        </p>
                        <p>To house the wiring, I made the base out of sheet metal steel. The process was much smoother
                            than
                            my first attempt at working with the medium.</p>

                        <p>Initially, I wanted to use water at the base of the structure, but I quickly realized that
                            water
                            and electronics don’t mix well. Instead, I adapted <a

                            I
                            cut traces out of a flexible copper sheet then mounted those to a large piece of foam core.
                            Having had established a serial connection in a couple of weeks prior, I programmed the

                        <p>The question of what aspect of music I wanted to illustrate loomed over me. Is it amplitude,
                            pitch, frequency? My original intention was to have an algorithm in place that tracks subtle
                            audio qualities without being too obvious. </p>
                        <p>Much like the other aspects of the project, my vision changed with time. I went with rhythm.
                            The
                            decision was subjective though I was influenced by dance parties. To capture rhythm, I
                            programmed my microphone board with a beat detection algorithm.</p>

                        <p>After taking Physics 123 with Tom Hayes at Harvard, I decided to revisit this project using
                            analog components. Analog parts are cheaper, and the approach seemed more intuitive to me.
                            Sound is an analog phenomenon, so analyzing it in the analog domain makes sense.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some notes on the schematic: the signal is picked up by a microphone and amplified using an
                            op-amp. It is then fed into a comparator directly (a potentiometer can be used to tweak the
                            voltage level) and through a leaky peak detector comprised of a diode, two
                            resistors, and a capacitor. The output of the comparator then turns an LED on or off, thus
                            flickering with the beat.</p>

                                        tutorial</a>. Following his steps, I made a parametric press-fit dodecahedron

                                <p>I returned to the same shape for this week's assignment. I designed a dodecahedron
                                    (using
                                    Rhino) with an inner cube. While learning about the shape I thought it was cool that
                                    a
                                    cube can be constructed from the vertices of a dodecahedron (Steinhaus 1999). I also
                                    wanted to 3D print something that wasn’t possible to make using a subtractive tool
                                    like
                                    a CNC. I used the Formalabs and 3DWOX to make models at different scales. The first
                                    couple of attempts were unsuccessful — not enough support, too little resin,
                                    excessive
                                    support, etc., but I eventually got it.</p>

                                    wanted to
                                    scan a feature that extends beyond what is visible to the naked eye. By capturing

                                    dissipation, I was curious to get a sense of the material properties of PLA. Our

                                    This week's assignment was challenging. I thought Eagle was janky (no partial
                                    search/match).
                                    The exported outer cut was too thin for the Roland (the table saw came in handy).
                                    The
                                    soldering was pretty smooth though. When testing my board, all of the traces seemed
                                    to
                                    check
                                    out. My board has two additional LED's. Here are my Eagle <a

                                    a metal shop… until now. I decided to make a light fixture. A cropped pyramid with
                                    openings from which light would be able to escape. While I was content with my
                                    design in
                                    Rhino, the final product was disappointing. On the brighter side, I got to use a
                                    grinder
                                    and nibbler. Hammering metal into shape was sweet.

                                <p>Just for fun, I designed a custom circuit board in Illustrator in the shape of a
                                    skull
                                    with two lights for eyes. Illustrator export settings didn’t play well with mods.
                                    When I
                                    tried to mill Morti (my name for the circuit board), the traces came out huge. The
                                    usual
                                    hack of halving the dimensions didn’t work. I will have to find the factor next
                                    week.

                                <p>Having had cast a relief previously, I felt ready. Once again, I set to make a light
                                    fixture — a hollow shape large enough for a light socket. Working in Rhino, I first
                                    designed the positive then with Rob’s help I made <a
                                        href="files/other/mold-container.stl">positive three-piece mold</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>On Sunday morning, it was time to mill. While my shape was relatively small, the mold
                                    positive was still larger than any of the available end mills at the shop. So, on
                                    Tuesday morning I borrowed a longer bit from the GSD. Once the milling was done, I
                                    realized I made a few errors. I resolved the errors with some tape, an X-Acto knife,
                                    and
                                    a sprinkling of Hydrostone.
                                    Then came the OOMOO. After vacuuming the substance a few times the mixture was still
                                    foamy (either due to my poor mixing skills or the compromised A/B parts) — a texture
                                    my
                                    final piece inherited.

                                    part and modifying the negative mold with clay and a blade, I was ready to pour.

                                    flawed, I was happy with the result. In future castings, I incorporated moss into

                                    Designing in
                                    EAGLE, took less time than before. The milling and soldering
                                    was also smooth sailing. Until...I realized only after my board was finished that
                                    one of
                                    the traces wasn’t cut. I X-Acto’ed it but I accidentally cut the wrong trace. Since
                                    the
                                    trace was under the microchip, neither a jumper wire nor 0 ohm resistor would work
                                    so I
                                    added a piece of copper. AND IT WORKED.</p>

                            <p>Using the code posted on the website I was able to program the board. My next steps are
                                to understand the python script better along with parsing serial. From there, I would
                                like to set up the LED so that it lights up once the sound level reaches a threshold.
                                And eventually beats.</p>

                                        Karimpour</a>, I experimented with Maya to create an interesting form for my
                                    composite. Everything came together nicely. Since the purpose of the work was
                                    aesthetic,
                                    I opted for linen in favor of burlap, which I dry fitted by making a few incisions
                                    lining the crevices. The form came out beautifully with a resolution so fine that
                                    the
                                    toolpath was apparent.

                                <p>This week I reproduced Neil's speaker board (with a few trace modifications) – my
                                    EAGLE
                                    <a href="files/other/sound-board.sch">schematic</a> and <a
                                        href="files/other/sound-board.brd">board</a> has a custom 2 pad part. While I
                                    was able to program the board using
                                    Neil's C files I was unable to "make it do something." This is what I hope to sort
                                    out
                                    for next week, perhaps by starting with Arduino's tone() library. In the meantime,

                                <p>I decided to use this week to focus on connecting the
                                    dots for my final project. I've set out to get data from my microphone board,
                                    process
                                    it, and integrate it into my speaker board. I was able to record data from my
                                    microphone
                                    board by tweaking <a href="files/other/hello.SPU0414HR5H.py">Neil's script</a>, and
                                    to trouble shoot my speaker board.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Recording the byte values and the timestamp yielded <a
                                        href="files/other/microphone_data.html"> some information</a>. Yet it didn’t get
                                    me
                                    very far. I had no idea how to parse the information to extract the musical signal.
                                    With
                                    the speaker, I realized that the voltage I was supplying to the it was too low. When
                                    I
                                    tried the same board with different speakers (a pair with a built-in amplifier) I
                                    was
                                    able to hear the sound. To mitigate this, I tried building a <a
                                        href="files/other/op-amp.sch">non-inverting amplifier</a> board which I forgot
                                    to power. Parsing through the speaker <a
                                        href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/output_devices/speaker/hello.speaker.45.c">C
                                        code</a> didn't get me
                                    far. While the idea for my final project idea is well defined, there are substantial
                                    gaps when it comes to implementation.

                                <p>This week I hooked up my speaker board to my microphone board. I decided to use the
                                    asynchronous serial bus method (aka the easy way). I was able to generate a random
                                    sound
                                    on my speaker board using the amplitude levels perceived by my microphone.

                                <p>The <a href="files/other/serial-using-arduinouno.ino">Arduino</a> reads in the serial
                                    data from the microphone and sends it along its Tx line.
                                    Meanwhile, serial is also set up on the <a

                                    help I made progress encoding my microphone board with a beat detection
                                    algorithm using Damian Peckett's method. To implement the code, I had to swap out
                                    the
                                    ATtiny45 with a ATtiny85 chip as the <a
                                        href="https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/section.Harvard/people/Geletina/files/other/beat_detection.ino">Arduino
                                        sketch</a> was consuming over 90% of the
                                    T45 memory. I had to run Burn Bootloader command and reconnect four resistors that
                                    came
                                    off when I replaced the chip.
                                    The other breakthrough was an improvement to my electronics schema. Instead of
                                    trying to
                                    house everything on one board or sending all the signals to all the microprocessors,
                                    I
                                    ran the beat detection algorithm on my speaker board sending serial communication
                                    only
                                    when a beat is detected. It felt more manageable to keep things modular.</p>

                                    ask myself: what is my dream machine? The answer is a wobbling hug bot that produces
                                    sounds at a comforting frequency and on occasion does dirty dishes. Complete with
                                    piezoelectric sensors the hug machine would be activated at moments of emotional
