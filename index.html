                    <p>The proposal I submitted at the beginning of the class was a responsive light installation. I
                        imagined the work would accompany a concert.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The logic seemed simple – lights, projection, and an algorithm. In terms of aesthetic, what I
                        had in mind are dreamy constellations. I initially hoped to go fully analog – relying more on
                        physics and less on digital technology.

                    <p>After experimenting with glass, realized I would have to commission a custom piece, which would
                        be expensive. My classmate Dan recommended polycarbonate – a cheap material with optic
                        properties. When heated, polycarbonate fractures internally and refracts. To amplify this
                        effect, I lined the bottom of my structure with reflective film.
                    </p>
                    <p>To house the wiring, I made the base out of sheet metal steel. The process was much smoother than
                        my first attempt at working with the medium.</p>

                    <p>Initially I wanted to use water at the base of the structure, but I quickly realized that water
                        and electronics don’t mix well. Instead, I adapted Neil's LED array. Using the vinyl cutter, I
                        cut traces out of a flexible copper sheet then mounted those to a large piece of foam core.
                        Having had established a serial connection in a couple of weeks prior I programmed the array to
                        communicate with my microphone board.</p>

                    <p>The question of what aspect of music I wanted to illustrate loomed over me. Is it amplitude,
                        pitch, frequency? My original intention was to have an algorithm in place that tracks subtle
                        audio qualities without being too obvious. </p>
                    <p>Much like the other aspects of the project, my vision changed with time. I went with rhythm. The
                        decision was subjective though I was influenced by dance parties. To capture rhythm, I
                        programmed my microphone board with a beat detection algorithm.</p>

                    <p>I am underwhelmed with the outcome of my project. Having said that, I think it’s a step in the
                        right direction. I’d love to explore analog alternatives and scale the project to fill a stage.

                    <p>After taking Physics 123 with Tom Hayes at Harvard, I decided to revist this project but do it
                        using analog components. An approach that is not only more economic in terms of $$$ but also
                        seemed more intuitive to me. Sound is an analog phenomenon so it makes sense to analyze it using
                        analog parts. Moreover, for a novice, a simpler approach is less dizzying and intimidating, thus
                        going further in terms of academic purposes.

                        Some notes on the schematic: the signal is picked up by a microphone and amplified using an
                        op-amp. It is then fed into a comparator directly (a potentiometer can be used to tweak the
                        voltage level) and through a leaky peak detector comprised of a diode, two
                        resistors, and a capacitor. The output of the comparator then turns an LED on or off, thus
                        flickering with the beat.</p>

                        <p>This was my favorite class. How to Make (almost) Anything gave me a holistic perspective on
                            technology. I felt empowered and fortunate to hone my craft. My hope is to pass this feeling
                            forward. I’d love for this site to be a useful source of encouragement. I made it using CSS,
                            HTML, and Javascript. To see more of my work or to get in touch, visit <a
